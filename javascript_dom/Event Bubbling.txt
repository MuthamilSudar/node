Event Bubbling: (default)

In the event bubbling phase, the event starts from the target element that triggered the event and bubbles up through its ancestors in the DOM hierarchy.
The most specific ancestor (closest to the target) receives the event first, followed by its parent, and so on, until it reaches the document root.

element.addEventListener('eventType', handlerFunction, false);


Event Capturing:
In the event capturing phase (also known as trickling), the event travels from the document root down to the target element.
The event is captured by the outermost ancestor first and then moves towards the target element.

element.addEventListener('eventType', handlerFunction, true);
